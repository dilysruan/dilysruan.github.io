         I am interested in answering cosmology questions (dark energy, dark matter, galaxy formation) through the tool of gravitational lensing. Currently I am studying how to improve measurements of the Hubble constant through free-form lens models of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing.  My advisor is Dr. <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~keeton/">Chuck Keeton</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lsst-stronglensing">LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration</a>. 
      <br>
         In undergrad, I studied radio pulsars using the Expanded Long Wavelength Array with the advisement of Dr. <a href="https://leo.phys.unm.edu/~gbtaylor/">Greg Taylor</a>. Before that, I compared deconvolution and masking algorithms in radio synthesis imaging with Dr. <a href="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~kgolap/">Kumar Golap</a> and Dr. <a href="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~ttsutsum/">Takahiro Tsutsumi</a> during my REU program.

         I believe it is vital to make physics and higher education more accessible, equitable, and diverse. I am a member of the Rutgers Minorities in Physics and Astronomy <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/rumipa/index.html">(MiPA)</a> group and serve as the co-organizer of our Equity and Inclusion Journal Club.

         I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the 505!). I am a second-generation Chinese American. My parents immigrated from Guangzhou, China in the 1980s and opened a restaurant in the US. I really admire my family and am so grateful for them.
