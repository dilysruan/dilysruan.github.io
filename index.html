										<strong> Research Interests: <strong> Cosmology -- Galaxy Formation, Dwarf Galaxies in Hydrodynamic Simulations -- HI mass and gas kinematics; weak lensing signal.
										<br>
										<br> Broadly, I am interested in how dark matter and baryonic physics influence each other in the formation of galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are the perfect laboratories to explore this due to their low masses! My advisor is Dr. Alyson Brooks. Currently I'm exploring the Baryonic Tully Fisher relationship in our simulated dwarfs (using pynbody with the Marvellous Merian and Marvel Suites). I am also part of the Merian Survey theory team, in which I study the HI gas kinematics and weak lensing shear amplitudes (using halotools) from our simulated dwarfs.

										Past projects:
										<br>
										<br>
 (2021-2023) Statistical bias in the Hubble constant due to the radial profile degeneracy with mock strong gravitational lenses (using pygravlens). <br> Advisor: Dr. Chuck Keeton, Rutgers University<br>
  <br>(2018-2020) Used the Expanded Long Wavelength Array (ELWA) to observe off-pulse emission from PSR B0950+08. We found that based on the off-pulse emission's shape and spectral index (using AIPS), it is likely from a pulsar wind nebula. <br> Advisor: Dr. Greg Taylor, University of New Mexico<br>

										<h2 class="major">About Me - Dilys Ruan</h2>
										<p>
										Second-generation Chinese-American || she/her || my name is pronounced like "D"+"Elise". I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm a coffee and tea enthusiast. Lately, crochet has been my favorite hobby!
										<br> 
										<br>
										In my opinion, the most important thing that academic communities should do (beyond research) is work towards equitable and accessible education. That is my goal as I navigate throughout my career. I'm an organizer in the Minorities in Physics and Astronomy (MiPA) group, an AAUP-AFT Rutgers union department representative, and co-president of the Rutgers Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Organization (RPAGSO). I also highly value active learning in my teaching pedagogy.
