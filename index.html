      <h2 style="color:GhostWhite;">Research</h2>
      <p style="color:GhostWhite;">
         My research focuses on answering questions in cosmology (expansion rate of the Universe, dark matter, galaxy formation) through the tool of gravitational lensing. Currently I am studying how to improve measurements of the Hubble constant through free form lens models of strongly lensed quasars.  My advisor is Dr. <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~keeton/">Chuck Keeton</a>. I am a member of the LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration.
         Previously in undergrad, I studied radio pulsars using the Expanded Long Wavelength Array with the advisement of Dr. <a href="https://leo.phys.unm.edu/~gbtaylor/">Greg Taylor</a>.

         I am a second-generation Chinese American. I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the 505!).
         <br>
         I believe it is vital to make physics and higher education more accessible. I am a member of the Rutgers Minorities in Physics and Astronomy <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/rumipa/index.html">(MiPA)</a> group and serve as the co-organizer of our Equity and Inclusion Journal Club.
